# About aquaOS
aquaOS is just a testing OS where I test my programming skills.

aquaOS was desinged around concept of simplicity hence the name "aquaOS" because you can't get more basic than water.

aquaOS is currently in it's early developmnet it dosen't have a proper GUI, but it will in future!

# Plans for aquaOS
November-December 2021 = Early version of GUI, improving the kernel

Late December-Early January = Adding stuf like clock, calendar, calculator and other basic stuff like text editor and a basic web browser

January-February 2022 = finishing GUI, improving optimization on lower end devices

March-April 2022 = Finishing touches

April-Rest of the year = bux fixes and adding more language support (for example polish,french, etc.)
