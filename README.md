## Future of aquaOS

### TL;DR = I'm not really sure what to do with aquaOS

So now that I'm working on ringOS Limine version,

I'm starting to ask my self "What is the point of aquaOS?"

I have PekOS for BIOS and older PC's, ringOS for UEFI, etc...

But what does aquaOS have that others (ringOS and other Poncho releated OS-es) don't?

Practically nothing

Now that that is out of way here are some of the possibilities of what to do with aquaOS:

1. Combine it with PekOS

2. Make it a Linux Distro

3. Archive it and stop development
